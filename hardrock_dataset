man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show

the white man had the schmaltz
the black man had the blues
no one knew what they was gonna do
but tchaikovsky had the news

he said, ""let there be sound""
there was sound
""let there be light""
there was light
""let there be drums""
there was drums
""let there be guitar""
there was guitar
oh, let there be rock


and it came to pass
that rock 'n' roll was born
and all across the land, every rockin' band
was blowing up a storm
and the guitar man got famous
the businessmen got rich
and in every bar, there was a superstar
with a seven year itch
there were fifteen-million fingers
learning how to play
and you could hear the fingers pickin'
and this is what they had to say:

""let there be light
sound
drums
guitar""

oh, let there be rock

one night, in the club called ""the shaking hand""
there was a  decibel rockin' band
and the music was good, and the music was loud
and the singer turned and he said to the crowd:

gettin' crazy, anticipating love and music

we were getting pretty good at the game
people stood in line and didn't seem to mind

livin' on rock-n-roll music
never worry 'bout the things we were missing
when we got up on the stage and got ready to play
everybody'd listen



playin' for a week in rhode island
a man came to the stage one night
he smoked a big cigar
drove a cadillac car
and said ""boys, i think this band's outta sight""
sign a record company contract
you know i've got great expectations
when i hear you on the car radio

and dream that you're still by my side
but that was yesterday
i had the world in my hands
but it's not the end of my world
just a slight change of plans

that was yesterday
but today life goes on
no more hiding in yesterday
because yesterday's gone

love, my love i gave it all
thought i saw the light
when i heard you call
life that we both could share
has deserted me
left me in despair
but now i stand alone with my pride
fighting back the tears i never let myself cry

but that was yesterday
love was torn from my hands
but it's not the end of my world
just a little hard to understand
that was yesterday
but today life goes on
you won't find me in yesterday's world
now yesterday's gone

goodbye yesterday
now it's over and done
still i hope somewhere deep in your heart
yesterday will live on"

i can't feel all the pressure, and i like it this way
but my body's calling, my body's calling:
""won't you come back to this world again?""
suspended deep in a sea of black
i've got the light at the end, i've got the bones on the mast
well, i've gone sailing, i've gone sailing
i could leave so easily, my friends are calling back to me
i said, they're, they're leavin' it all up to me
when all i needed was clarity, and
someone to tell me what the fuck is goin' on
goddamn it
slipping farther and farther away
it's a miracle how long we can stay
in a world our minds created
in a world that's full of shit

help me
""okay, let's get this guy in the program please, we're losing him."" ""start an iv please.""
help me

i'm climbing through the wreckage of all my twisted dreams
but this cheap investigation just can't stifle all my screams
and i'm waiting at the crossroads, waiting for you
waiting for you, where are you?
no one's going to bother me anymore
no one's going to mess with my head no more
i can't understand what all the fighting's for
but it's so nice here, down off the shore
i wish you could see this, 'cause there's nothing to see
it's peaceful here and it's fine with me
not like the world where i used to live
i never really wanted to live, ah

i know
""okay, we're starting to lose this guy. i want that iv and his airway protected!""
""let's get some people in here!""
""get the crash cart please, we're losing this guy. he's going..."" ""give me an airway please""
""... going under.""
""clear""
zap him again

""i just don't give a shit anymore""
""i love you""
you live your life like it's a coma, won't you tell me why we'd wanna?
with all the reasons you give, it's, it's kinda hard to believe
but who am i to tell you that i've seen any reason why you should stay?
maybe we'd be better off without you, anyway
you got a one-way ticket, on your last chance ride
got a one-way ticket to your suicide
got a one-way ticket, and there's no way out alive
an' all this crass communication that has left you in the cold
isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old
but if home is where the heart is, then there's stories to be told
no, you don't need a doctor, no one else can heal your soul
got your mind in submission, got your life on the line
but nobody pulled the trigger, they just stepped aside
they be down by the water while you watch 'em waving goodbye
they be calling in the morning, they be hanging on the phone
they be waiting for an answer, but you know nobody's home
when the bell's stopped ringing it was nobody's fault, but your own
there were always ample warnings, there were always subtle signs
and you would have seen it comin' but we gave you too much time
and when you said that no one's listening, why'd your best friend drop a dime?
sometimes, we get so tired of waiting for a way to spend our time
an' it's so easy to be social, it's so easy to be cool
yeah, it's easy to be hungry, when you ain't got shit to lose
and i wish that i could help you with what you hope to find
but i'm still out here, waiting, watching reruns of my life
when you reach the point of breaking, know it's gonna take some time
to heal the broken memories that another man would need just to survive"

i needed time to think, to get the memories from my mind
what did i see? can i believe
that what i saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
just what i saw, in my old dreams
were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
cos in my dreams, it's always there
the evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
yeah
night was black, was no use holding back
cos i just had to see, was someone watching me?
in the mist, dark figures move and twist
was all this for real, or just some kind of hell?

six-six-six, the number of the beast
hell and fire was spawned to be released

torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
as they start to cry, hands held to the sky
in the night, the fires are burning bright
the ritual has begun, satan's work is done

six-six-six, the number of the beast
sacrifice is going on tonight

this can't go on, i must inform the law
can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
but i feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
seem to mesmerize, can't avoid the eyes

see his eye as he stops one of three
mesmerises one of the wedding guests
stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea

and the music plays on, as the bride passes by
caught by a spell and the mariner tells his tale

driven south to the land of the snow and ice
to a place where nobody's been
through the snow, fog flies on the albatross
hailed in god's name, hoping good luck it brings
and the ship sails on, back to the north
through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on


the mariner kills the bird of good omen
his shipmates cry against what he's done
but when the fog clears, they justify him
and make themselves a part of the crime

sailing on and on and north across the sea
sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm

the albatross begins with its vengeance
a terrible curse, a thirst has begun
his shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
about his neck, the dead bird is hung

and the curse goes on and on and on at sea
and the thirst goes on and on for them and me
""day after day, day after day
we stuck nor breath nor motion
as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
water, water everywhere, and all the boards did shrink
water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink""


""there,"" calls the mariner, ""there comes a ship o’er the line
but how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?""
see, onward she comes
onward she nears, out of the sun
see, she has no crew
she has no life, wait but there's two

death and she life-in-death
they throw their dice for the crew
she wins the mariner and he belongs to her now
then, crew one by one
they drop down dead, two hundred men
she, she, life-in-death
she lets him live, her chosen one

""one after one by the star-dogged moon
too quick for groan or sigh
each turned his face with a ghastly pang
and cursed me with his eye
four times fifty living men
and i heard nor sigh nor groan
with heavy thump, a lifeless lump
they dropped down one by one.""


the curse, it lives on in their eyes
the mariner he wished he'd die
along with the sea creatures
but they lived on, so did he

and by the light of the moon
he prays for their beauty, not doom
with heart he blesses them
god's creatures all of them too

then the spell starts to break
the albatross falls from his neck
sinks down like lead into the sea
then down in falls comes the rain, hahaha


hear the groans of the long-dead seamen
see them stir and they start to rise
bodies lifted by good spirits
none of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes

and revenge still is sought, penance starts again
cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on

now the curse is finally lifted
and the mariner sights his home
spirits go from the long-dead bodies
form their own light and the mariner's left alone


and then a boat came sailing towards him
it was a joy he could not believe
the pilot's boat, his son, and the hermit
penance of life will fall onto him

and the ship, it sinks like lead into the sea
and the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins

the mariner's bound to tell of his story
to tell this tale wherever he goes
to teach god's word by his own example
that we must love all things that god made

and the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
and the tale goes on and on and on and on"

about a thing that i saw
one night wandering in the everglades
i'd one drink but no more
i was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
gazing up at the stars
not aware of a presence so near to me
watching my every move

feeling scared and i fell to my knees
as something rushed me from the trees
took me to an unholy place
and that is where i fell from grace
then they summoned me over to join in with them
to the dance of the dead
into the circle of fire i followed them
into the middle i was led
as if time had stopped still i was numb with fear
but still i wanted to go
and the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
as i walked onto the coals
and i felt i was in a trance
and my spirit was lifted from me
and if only someone had the chance
to witness what happened to me

and i danced, and i pranced, and i sang with them
all had death in their eyes
lifeless figures - they were undead - all of them
they had ascended from hell

as i danced with the dead
my free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
below my undead body
just danced the circle of dead
until the time came to reunite us both
my spirit came back down to me
i didn't know if i was alive or dead
as the others all joined in with me
by luck then a skirmish started
and took the attention away from me
when they took their gaze from me
was the moment that i fled
i ran like hell, faster than the wind
but behind i did not glance
one thing that i did not dare
was to look just straight ahead

when you know that your time has come around
you know you'll be prepared for it
say your last goodbyes to everyone
have a drink and say a prayer for it

when you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
when you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead

to this day i guess i'll never know
just why they let me go
but i'll never go dancing no more

baptizing them her water from the ballast fore and aft
now she slips into our past

feeling the diesels that push you along
watching the channel below you
lower and lower into the night
lights are passing below you
northern france asleep in their beds
storm is raging around you
a million to one, that’s what he said


reaper standing beside her
with his scythe cuts to the bone
panic to make a decision
experienced men asleep in their graves
her cover is ripped and she’s drowning
rain is flooding into the hull
bleeding to death and she’s falling
lifting gas is draining away



“we’re down lads“ came the cry
bow plunging from the sky
three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
the flares to guide her path, ignited at the last
the empire of the clouds
just ashes in our past, just ashes at the last

here lie their dreams as i stand in the sun
on the ground where they built and the engines did run
to the moon and the stars
now what have we done?
oh, the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on
dreams live on, dreams live on, on


now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east
the empire of the clouds may rest in peace
and in a country churchyard laid head to the mast
eight and forty souls who came to die in france"

see myself in the hall of mirrors

laughing sorrow inside your head
can’t get out just a feeling of dread

the artful dodger he counts his stash
the joker’s wild like an impish child
while madame fortune she waits inside
the good luck charm is overkill
the tired old soldier says fire at will
planes overhead go search destroy
the ones below human decoy
i need somebody to save me
meanwhile we play the waiting game
the clock is struck the horse is lame
and when we think that this is done
chance your luck a four leafed one
you hedge your bets the battle lost
to wait in vain and count the cost
the thin edged line
between good and bad
and cast the luck be happy sad

look in their eyes and you send them away

in our hearts we have made our home
where our children all have grown
precious moments time cannot erase
we have been living up and down the gypsy highway
seasons that we have learned to share apart
somehow in my heart i always keep you near me
after all these years
after all these years
you stood by me
the days and nights that i was gone
after all these years
you sacrificed, believed in me
and you stood strong
because with our love there's nothing left to fear
after all these years"

all eyes hit me as i walked into the bar
and seeing other guys were fooling in the denim dudes
a couple cards played rough stuff, new york, fire island
i cased the joint, straining at the scenes

i moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'
i snapped the smile off his face and scowled ""give me a bourbon""
the mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
all the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action
the scene screwed me up, i saw some contact
then the big boys saw me and knew that
i'd had too much, floating around
statues alive, seconds are hours


sacks like a hurricane, wrapped in and shattered
i was barely holding on to this flying body symphony
i guess i dream in pictures, not colours
the true free expression i demand is human rights, right
i gave my life, i am immortal

faced away from your heart
those last few nights
it turned and sliced you apart
this love that i tell
now feels lonely as hell
from this padded prison cell
so many times i said
you'd only be mine
i gave my blood and my tears
and loved you, cyanide
when you took my lips
i took your breath
sometimes love's better off dead
you're all i need
make you only mine
(i loved you)
so i set you free
i had to take your life
(you're all i need)
you're all i need
you're all i need
and i loved you so
but you didn't love me

laid out cold
now we're both alone
but killing you
helped me keep you home
i guess it was bad
cause love can be sad
but we finally made the news
tied up smiling
i thought you were happy
never opened your eyes
i thought you were napping
well, i got so much to learn
about love in this world
but we finally made the news
you're all i need
make you only mine
(i loved you)
so i set you free
i had to take your life

i'd like to move on and make the most of the night
maybe a kiss before i leave you this way
your lips are so cold, i don't know what else to say

you can't escape the master keeper

what you saw can be hell on this earth, hell on this earth

it's catching you but you don't see
the reaper's you and the reaper is me

breaking laws, knocking doors, but there's no one at home
made your bed, rest your head, but you lie there and moan
where to hide, suicide is the only way out
don't you know what it's really about

ah, now people, you really know where it's at
ah, ah you got it, fox
get the flaps out, satan, satan, satan, ha ha ha

so i pretend you're here by my side
tonight on this lonely ride
i keep telling myself that...

life goes on
while your miles away
and i need you
time rolls on
as night steals the day
there's nothing i can do
you healed up my wounds
i tasted your tears
you spilled out your heart
so i let out my fears
but one fear i kept to myself
how i prayed that you loved no one else
like you're saying you love me...
chorus:
life goes on
while your miles away
and i need you
time rolls on
as night steals the day
there's nothing i can do
if you only knew
how much i miss you
solo
when my mind plays it's tricks on me
it shows me things i don't want to see
that's why i tell myself now
i keep telling myself now
just take another piece of me...

there's nothing i can do

i travel with you

the pictures that give pleasure to your eye

""...behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, i found it. i brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in my hands. i had no idea what it might be, but it was beautiful...""
""...i learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound differently. as i struck the wires with my other hand, i produced my first harmonious sounds, and soon my own music! how different it could be from the music of the temples! i can't wait to tell the priests about it!...""

what can this strange device be?
when i touch it, it gives forth a sound
it's got wires that vibrate and give music
what can this thing be that i found?

see how it sings like a sad heart
and joyously screams out its pain
sounds that build high like a mountain
or notes that fall gently like rain

i can't wait to share this new wonder
the people will all see its light
let them all make their own music
the priests praise my name on this night

""...in the sudden silence as i finished playing, i looked up to a circle of grim, expressionless faces. father brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent temple hall...""
""...instead of the grateful joy that i expected, they were words of quiet rejection! instead of praise, sullen dismissal. i watched in shock and horror as father brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet...""

to come before you so
but i've found an ancient miracle
i thought that you should know
listen to my music
and hear what it can do

it's just a waste of time

""...i see still the incredible beauty of the sculptures cities, and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world. i was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as i saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed by the federation long ago. i saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things...""
i wandered home though silent streets
and fell into a fitful sleep
escape to realms beyond the night
dream, can't you show me the light?

i stand atop a spiral stair
an oracle confronts me there
he leads me on light years away
through astral nights, galactic days
i see the works of gifted hands
that grace this strange and wondrous land
i see the hand of man arise
with hungry mind and open eyes

they left our planets long ago
the elder race still learn and grow
their power grows with purpose strong
to claim the home where they belong
home to tear the temples down...
home to change!

""...i have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total despair. i have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now. i can no longer live under the control of the federation, but there is no other place to go. my last hope is that with my death i may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last...""

the sleep is still in my eyes
the dream is still in my head
i heave a sigh and sadly smile
and lie awhile in bed
i wish that it might come to pass
not fade like all my dreams

just think of what my life might be
in a world like i have seen!
i don't think i can carry on
carry on this cold and empty life
oh no!

my spirits are low in the depths of despair
my lifeblood... spills over

that no one knows about
he says it used to be a farm
before the motor law
and on sundays i elude the eyes
and hop the turbine freight
to far outside the wire
where my white-haired uncle waits

jump to the ground
as the turbo slows to cross the borderline
run like the wind
as excitement shivers up and down my spine
down in his barn
my uncle preserved for me an old machine
for fifty-odd years
to keep it as new has been his dearest dream
i strip away the old debris
that hides a shining car
a brilliant red barchetta
from a better, vanished time
we fire up the willing engine
responding with a roar
tires spitting gravel
i commit my weekly crime

wind in my hair
shifting and drifting
mechanical music
adrenaline surge
well-weathered leather
hot metal and oil
the scented country air
sunlight on chrome
the blur of the landscape
every nerve aware


suddenly, ahead of me
across the mountainside
a gleaming alloy air-car
shoots towards me, two lanes wide
i spin around with shrieking tires
to run the deadly race
go screaming through the valley
as another joins the chase
drive like the wind
straining the limits of machine and man
laughing out loud with fear and hope
i've got a desperate plan
at the one-lane bridge
i leave the giants stranded at the riverside
race back to the farm
to dream with my uncle at the fireside"

the struggle of the ancients first began
the gods of love and reason
sought alone to rule the fate of man

they battled through the ages
but still neither force would yield
the people were divided
every soul a battlefield
every soul a battlefield


""i bring truth and understanding
i bring wit and wisdom fair
precious gifts beyond compare
we can build a world of wonder
i can make you all aware
i will find you food and shelter
show you fire to keep you warm
through the endless winter storm
you can live in grace and comfort
in the world that you transform""

the people were delighted
coming forth to claim their prize
they ran to build their cities
and converse among the wise
but one day the streets fell silent
yet they knew not what was wrong
the urge to build these fine things
seemed not to be so strong
the wise men were consulted
and the bridge of death was crossed
in quest of dionysus
to find out what they had lost

""i bring love to give you solace
in the darkness of the night
in the heart's eternal light
you need only trust your feelings
only love can steer you right
i bring laughter, i bring music
i bring joy and i bring tears
i will soothe your primal fears
throw off those chains of reason
and your prison disappears""

the cities were abandoned
and the forests echoed song
they danced and lived as brothers
they knew love could not be wrong
food and wine they had aplenty
and they slept beneath the stars
the people were contented
and the gods watched from afar
but the winter fell upon them
and it caught them unprepared
bringing wolves and cold starvation
and the hearts of men despaired


the universe divided
as the heart and mind collided
with the people left unguided
for so many troubled years
in a cloud of doubts and fears
their world was torn asunder into hollow
hemispheres

some fought themselves, some fought each other
most just followed one another
lost and aimless like their brothers
for their hearts were so unclear
and the truth could not appear
their spirits were divided into blinded
hemispheres

some who did not fight
brought tales of old to light
'my rocinante sailed by night
on her final flight'
to the heart of cygnus' fearsome force
we set our course
spiralled through that timeless space
to this immortal place


i have memory and awareness
but i have no shape or form
as a disembodied spirit
i am dead and yet unborn
i have passed into olympus
as was told in tales of old
to the city of immortals
marble white and purest gold

i see the gods in battle rage on high
thunderbolts across the sky
i cannot move, i cannot hide
i feel a silent scream begin inside

then all at once the chaos ceased
a stillness fell, a sudden peace
the warriors felt my silent cry
and stayed their struggle, mystified
apollo was astonished
dionysus thought me mad
but they heard my story further
and they wondered and were sad

looking down from olympus
on a world of doubt and fear
its surface splintered into
sorry hemispheres

they sat a while in silence
then they turned at last to me
""we will call you cygnus
the god of balance you shall be""


we can walk our road together
if our goals are all the same
we can run alone and free
if we pursue a different aim
let the truth of love be lighted
let the love of truth shine clear
sensibility, armed with sense and liberty
with the heart and mind united in a single perfect sphere"

the mess and the magic
triumphant and tragic
a mechanized world out of hand

for superior cynics
who dance to a synthetic band

science, like nature, must also be tamed
with a view towards its preservation
given the same state of integrity
it will surely serve us well
art as expression, not as market campaigns
will still capture our imaginations
given the same state of integrity
it will surely help us along

the most endangered species: the honest man
will still survive annihilation
forming a world, state of integrity
sensitive, open and strong

wave after wave will flow with the tide
and bury the world as it does
tide after tide will flow and recede
leaving life to go on as it was"

to make this story line come true
can you feel me tremble when we touch
can you feel the hand of fate
reaching out to both of us
this love affair can't wait
i can't hold back
i'm on the edge
i can't hold back
your voice explodes
inside my head
i can't hold back
i won't back down
girl, it's too late
to turn back now
another shooting star goes by
and in the night the silence
speaks to you and i
and now the time has come at last
don't let the moment run too fast
i can feel you tremble when we touch
and i feel the hand of fate
reaching out to both of us
there's a story in my eyes
turn the pages of desire
now it's time to trade those dreams
for the rush of passion's fire
i can't hold back
i'm on the edge
i can't hold back
your voice explodes
inside my head
i can't hold back
i won't back down

don't get discouraged, don't be afraid
we can make it through another day
make it worth the price we pay

the good book says it's better to give than to receive
i do my best to do my part
nothin' in my pockets, i got nothin' up my sleeve
i keep my magic in my heart
keep up your spirit, keep up your faith, baby
i am counting on you
you know what you've got to do
fight the good fight every moment
every minute, every day
fight the good fight every moment
it's your only way

all your life you've been waiting for your chance
where you'll fit into the plan
but you're the master of your own destiny
so give and take the best that you can

you think that a little more money can buy your soul some rest
you better think something else instead
you're so afraid of being honest with yourself
you'd better take a look inside your head
nothing is easy, nothing good is free, but i
i can tell you where to start
take a look inside your heart
there's an answer in your heart

fight the good fight every moment
every minute, every day
fight the good fight every moment
make it worth the price we pay
every moment of your lifetime
every minute and every day
fight the good fight every moment
make it worth the price we pay"

one lonely sunday morning
her long hair flowing
in the mid-winter wind
i know not how she found me
for in darkness i was walking
and destruction lay around me 
from a fight i could not win

ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
she asked me name my foes then
i said the need within some men
to fight and kill their brothers
without thought of love or god
and i begged her give me horses
to trample down my enemies
so eager was my passion
to devour this waste of life

ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah

but she would not think of battle
that reduces men to animals
so easy to begin and yet
impossible to end
for she the mother of all men
had counselled me so wisely then
i feared to walk alone again
and asked if she would stay
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah

""oh lady lend your hand,"" i cried
""oh let me rest here at your side""
""have faith and trust in me,"" she said
and filled my heart with life
""there is no strength in numbers
have no such misconception
but when you need me be assured
i won't be far away""

ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah

thus having spoke she turned away
and though i found no words to say
i stood and watched until i saw her
black cloak disappear
my labour is no easier
but now i know i'm not alone
i'll find new heart each time i
think upon that windy day
and if one day she comes to you
drink deeply from her words so wise
take courage from her as your prize

all your dreams are strange
love comes walkin' in
some kind of alien
waits for the opening
then simply pulls a string

another world, some other time
you lay your sanity on the line
familiar faces, familiar sights
reach back, remember with all your might
ooh, and there she stands in a silken gown
silver lights shining down

latami stać w kolejce, która nazywa się pociąg
wysokie progi, nie wszyscy przeskoczą - to pewne!

mógłbyś ją nosić na rękach, oddać się jej i być wiernym
chciałbyś mieć kluczyk do serca jej - być dla niej odźwiernym
chociaż kumple ci mówią, że cię wali po rogach!
ty w niej widzisz anioła zesłanego do ciebie przez boga
gdy jest już bardzo pijana to mówisz ""kochanie, już dosyć""
pamiętasz jak wymiotowała? trzymałeś jej włosy
zaprowadziłeś do taksówki, spała ci na kolanach
delikatne drapanie główki - lubiła być miziana
podwózka pod dom, otwarcie furtki, scena
przed pocałunkiem, ale te pocałunki wciąż bez zaproszenia są bez zaproszenia
choć nie chce się przyznać to kocha się w tobie
a ciebie cieszy nawet to, że dostałeś raz zgodę wycisnąć jej pryszcza na czole...

chcesz byle była blisko, bierzesz ją na disco i tańczysz z nią nawet jak jest ślisko
dancing trwa, a muza płynie jak chcesz
pod koszulą ""s"", czujesz się jak clark kent
gdy inni patrzą, ich kobiety się martwią po tym
facetów biorą za łeb!
każą im patrzeć w oczy, choć nie chcą teraz i nie chcą w nocy
masz to gdzieś! największa z gwiazd jest obok, więc wszystko jest ""mua!""

anioł z diabłem w środku
brałbyś ją całą jak kota w worku
najlepsze co w życiu się stało to ty!
