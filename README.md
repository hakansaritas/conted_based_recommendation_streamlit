# conted_based_recommendation_streamlit

I found a jukebox containing only 80's hard rock songs in one of the vintage shops...the story is begginig like that ..

The subject of "Contenten based song recommendation on hard rock lyrics" was a project with a Back-End and a Front-End.

There are three kind of recommendation selection engines.

1 - Recommendation by Song Title
2 - Recommendation by Your Title and Text ( its mean your lyrics).
3 - Latent Dirichlet Allacotion Recommendation by 3 Songs.
